The two data visualizers together provide a comprehensive view of Shopify sales performance. The first visualizer serves as a high-level dashboard, presenting overall transaction metrics, customer behavior, regional sales distribution, sales trends over time, payment method breakdowns, and product-type performance. It also includes interactive filters such as "Select Measure," "Gateway," and "Province" to allow users to customize and drill down into specific aspects of the data. The second visualizer, labeled as the Details Tab, presents a detailed table listing individual customer transactions along with order information, product types, and billing locations. Together, these visualizers support both strategic analysis and detailed operational review.
